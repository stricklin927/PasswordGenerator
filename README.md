# PasswordGenerator
MSU - Homework 03: Password Generator

## Overview
For this project I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.
A simple click of a button, copies the password to the user's clipboard.
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
